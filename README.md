# Halmak/Karabiner setup

Just my configs generator for karabiner, the idea goes somewhat like this:

I have a mechanical keyboard that's flashed with Halmak. And I want a seamless
transition between that and the internal macbook keyboard. So that when I pull
it in and out of my desktop dock, it would stay with Halmak by default without
the need to mess with the macOS input sources and custom layouts.

It also does automatic CTL/CMD swap for the external mechanical keyboard, so I
would have a seamless transition between macOS and windows
